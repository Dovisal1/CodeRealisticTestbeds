16,"1. A sample of 375 urban Census tracts was randomly selected without replacement using the ""Random Choice"" function in Mathematica from a list of 58,331 urban Census tracts encompassing the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. For each Census tract in the sample, all service providers with residential subscribers in the Census tract were requested to provide rates for all service plans in that Census tract. If a service provider offered service in more than 25 Census tracts of the sample, a subsample of 25 Cenus tracts was randomly selected for survey responses from that service provider using the ""Random Choice"" function in Mathematica.",
