### Issue

* There exists a digital divide between web developers and internet users in the United States.

### Problem

* Internet researchers and developers mainly use high-speed home or university Internet connections to test new ideas, or they use dedicated infrastructure called "testbeds" that have good quality links.
:*  Some tests are done directly connected to university networks, which have much better speeds than most home users.  
:*  Some tests are done on GENI, where the default link speed is much higher than most US households' download speed.
 * Many researchers do not change link characteristics on test setup to something more realistic.
