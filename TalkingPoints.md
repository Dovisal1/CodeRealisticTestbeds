### Issue

* There exists a digital divide between web developers and internet users in the United States.

### Problem

* Internet researchers and developers don't do tests on realistic links.
* 
..* Some tests are done directly connected to university networks, which have much better speeds than most home users.  
..* Some tests are done on GENI, where the default link speed is much higher than most US households' download speed.

* Many researchers do not change link characteristics on test setup to something more realistic.
