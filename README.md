 There exists a digital divide between web developers and internet users in the United States. Some households do not have high-speed Internet avavilable in their area, or cannot pay for high-speed Internet. As a result, there is a lot of variation in Internet speed across households in the US. We see this in the image below, which shows the relative frequency of different download speeds of US households. Meanwhile, web developers and researchers usually have top-notch internet connections. This disparity is called the "digital divide".

 Internet researchers and developers mainly use high-speed home or university Internet connections to test new ideas, or they use dedicated infrastructure called "testbeds" that have good quality links. Sometimes they use a single device, or a small sample of machines to run tests, but these tests are done directly connected to university networks, which have much better speeds than most users.  
 
 Alternatively, GENI is a platform that researchers use to test developments on dedicated research infrastructure. When using GENI, reseachers use a web-based interface in which virtual machines (VMs) can be dragged onto the canvas area, and connected by links (as show in the screenshot below). These virtual machines and links are then reserved at one of a set of server racks at universities across the US, and researchers can log into each of the virtual machines, install networked applications, and use them and measure their performance. However, the default link speed on GENI is 100 megabits per second, which we see in the image above is much higher than most US households' download speed. Also, default latency and packet loss on GENI is minimal, which does not at all similar to real household network connections.

Characteristics such as download speed, upload speed, latency, jitter, and packet loss, _can_ be changed on GENI.   However, many researchers do not change these to something more realistic. If researchers do not deliberately change characteristics of the link to match their target users' network characteristics, the network that they test on will not accurately represent real households.

 
 
 
 What ultimately stems from this digital divide is a situation where due to the fact that developers do not test their advancements on a variety of realistic networks, many of the advancements made do not work as intended for millions of Americans who have different internet speeds. The rising popularity of testbeds hosted on universities across America has given researchers a more efficient way to test advancements. One such testbed that I focused on is the GENI Testbed. 
 
 
 
 Our goal was to create more realistic networks on GENI. With more realistic networks to test on, researchers should be able to make advancements that have a better impact on more Americans' internet. Our tool takes an input of state, price range, and technology so researchers can limit their outputs to households that represent the target group of their development. For example, if a researcher is trying to make an application specifically for lower income communities, then the researcher would most likely search for a household paying a lower price. Then, our tool looks through a dataset, and randomly selects one household that matches all the given parameters. For example, if a researcher filetered for prices between 35 and 70 dollars, all of these households could have been returned. ![map](https://github.com/csmithsalzberg/CodeRealisticTestbeds/blob/master/justmap.PNG) The dataset comes from measurements in the Measuring Broadband America program. Measuring Broadband America uses volunteer panelists paying different prices for different speeds, and from different locations. Potential panelists are checked to see that they closely match the overall state and region statistics of Internet access connections in the United States before acceptance to the program.

Once an actual household is selected from the dataset, the information from the household can be used in two ways. Our code generates a script that can be put into GENI to create a small network. In the network, one machine represents the user, and the other represents the server. The link between the user and the server has the same qualities as the selected household. Because there are no outside factors involved, GENI allows researchers to test advancements in  a very controlled environment. ![GENI topology](https://github.com/csmithsalzberg/CodeRealisticTestbeds/blob/master/GENIposter.PNG) So, if we run the script searching for a New York household using Fios, as was done here, we could get different characteristics each time. The idea is that if it is tested on multiple similar households, researchers will get a better idea whether or not their application works under different circumstances.

Our tool generates a profile where a researcher can connect to after setting up a VPN and a proxy server in addition to the GENI network. ![ATC](https://github.com/csmithsalzberg/CodeRealisticTestbeds/blob/master/profiles.PNG) The link between the VPN and the proxy also has the same characteristics as the sample household. Then, researchers can browse the internet using that households speeds, latency, and other features. Since researchers only have control over the link between the VPN and the proxy, and not the link from the researchers device to the VPN, and from the proxy to the web, this method includes outside influences on the network that GENI does not have. The GENI network is completely controlled by whoever created that network. Facebook instituted a program called "2G Tuesdays" where employees have the option of using worse internet speeds, using the same setup as our tool. For one hour one Tuesdays, employees can use their application with the internet of the developing world, in order to get a better understanding of how people with worse internet speeds experience their applications [2]. This experiment actually had a big impact on the Facebook team, and they have said that the experiment led them to change some parts of the Messenger app. We hope that the GENI network and the internet profile our tool generates will have a similar impact on researchers. Our ultimate goal is that the tool will allow researchers to test their applications under more realistic conditions, which should lead them to design more effective developements for everybody.
