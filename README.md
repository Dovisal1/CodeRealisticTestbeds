# Background
Our internet lags in terms of speed and affordability for more than multiple reasons. A lack of competition which leads to monopolies is a major reason for the bad service. I however focused on a different issue that negatively effects internet service for the average user. There exists a "Digital Divide" between web-developers and internet users in the United States. While web-developers usually have top-notch internet conenctions, the US population's internet varies greatly (insert graph I will generate with MBA data). Also, many of the testbeds are hosted on universities across America. This means that they are subject to very similar network settings, making them very undiverse (cite seattle https://isis.poly.edu/~jcappos/papers/muhammad_seattle_geni_12.pdf). What stems from this Digital Divide is a situation where due to the fact that developers do not test their advancements on a variety of realistic networks, many of the advancements made do not work as intended for millions of Americans who have different internet speeds. Several efforts have been made in order to bridge this divide. Programs such as Google Fiber hope to provide faster and cheaper internet, and community networks look to provide many more with high internet speeds. Another potential solution which I am also working on is with testbeds. Oftentimes, developers only use a single device, or a small sample of similar nodes to run tests. The introduction of testbeds has changed this. Researchers can now test their advancements on testbeds, but as stated early, most of these testbeds are run with University settings. However, it is possible to change the settings of the nodes in a topology on a testbed: characteristics such as link capacity, download speed, upload speed, latency, jitter, and packet loss can all be implemented into the system. I used data from the Measuring Broadband America program in order to acquire this information.
